# Overview of the Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to take NYC CitiBike ride sharing data, consisting of the Gender of people who rent Citi share bikes, checkout times, the duration of the rental and the days of the week the rental were conducted. The data was analyzed and used to create five different visualizations: Checkout Time for Users, Checkout Times by Gender, Trips by Weekday for Each Hour, Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) and User Trips by Gender by Weekday.  The visualizations will be presented to potential investors that are interested in helping the rideshare initiative expand and grow.

## Results

Visualization 1: Checkout Times by Gender

The visualized data shows that primarily 108,087 males rent bikes for five minutes, 34,151 of females rent bikes for six minutes and 7,389 of an unknown gender rent bikes for 11 minutes. The data shows that a large majority of the people who rent bikes are males and that all three gender groups are only using the bikes for 5-11 minutes.

Visualization 2: Checkout Times for Users

The visualized data shows that 146,752 of user rent the bikes for fives minutes. Most ride durations are for 20 minutes or less and the number of users that rent bikes for longer is very small. 

Visualization 3: Trips by Weekday for Each Hour

The visualized data shows that Monday through Friday at 8 AM is when about 27,000 to 36,500 of users rent bikes and the highest number of users rent bikes on Thursday. It also shows that from 5 PM to 6 PM, about 36,000 to 44,910 users rent bikes and the highest number of users rent bikes on Thursday. It appears most of the bike rentals are being conducted during times that users are going to and getting off work. 

Visualization 4: Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

The visualized data shows that mostly males are renting bikes during the time mentioned in the above visualization. 

Visualization 5: User Trips by Gender by Weekday

The visualized data shows that most of the subscribers are males and over 259,000 of the users rent bikes on Thursdays. Females make the next largest group of subscribers and bike renters. 
## Summary

The visualized data shows that a large majority of the people that rent bikes are males and the duration of time they rent the bikes is below 20 minutes. To create a bigger scope of the data, I would obtain data to represent what the users are renting the bikes for and if they would like to see more bike stations added throughout their respective cities.
